# Clio

This repository will contain the code for *Clio: Real-time Task-Driven Open-Set 3D Scene Graphs*. 

![Clio](./assets/overview-figure.jpg)

We propose Clio, a novel approach for building task-driven 3D scene graphs in real-time with embedded open-set semantics. We draw inspiration from the classical Information Bottleneck principle to form task- relevant clusters of object primitives given a set of natural language tasks — such as ''Read brown textbook'' — and by clustering the scene into task-relevant semantic regions such as “Kitchenette” or “Workspace”.
